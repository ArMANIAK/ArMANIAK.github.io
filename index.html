                                This mock-up was stated as a survival mode for our group. The most difficult parts were making correct media quaries, 
                                setting proper position properties and values and completing part with tabs without bootstrap. So I trained these difficult parts on this page.

                            And it was easy to answer 'Yes', but if You tried to choose 'No' the button starts running away from pointer. I tried to make something similar to that joke.

                                I tried to make this game more complicated: both design and logic. I've added sort of UI and controls. I'm not sure whether the logic is the simpliest but it works.

                                When the tutor reminded us about final projects we were a little bit confused. Well, totally confused to be honest. Few of us had ideas what to do as a final projects. 
                                Others asked what projects can be performed, what idea to choose. So this was a sort of idea-generator. Try it if You are in doubts =)

                                This is my own project. For Ukrainian Red Cross Society I have developed a board game about first aid.
                                Later on volunteers designated cards and illustrations for this game and it was published. I want to port this game into web.
