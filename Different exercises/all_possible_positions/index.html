    <h1>All possible positions</h1>
    <p>This task was suggested by my mate in junior programmers chat. Developer is supposed to write code wich wile receive a string and return array of strings with dots in all possible positions in all possible variations. 
        Like "abc" string results "a.bc", "ab.c", "a.b.c", "abc".
    </p>
    <p>
        At first, I had totally no idea how to do that. Then I found out the algorithm and started thinking on how I should implement it.
